But letting the warming rise just a half-degree, to 2°C, would add an average of 4 inches of global sea level rise. Going above 1.5 degrees of warming puts millions more at risk of potentially life-threatening heatwaves and poverty. It all but wipes out coral reefs that entire ecosystems rely on worldwide.

The environment of water bodies that are near the public will be further improved to increasingly meet people\'s scenic, entertainment and sports demands.

Guangdong province has the largest mangrove area, accounting for 41 percent of the total stretch. A total of 487 hectares of mangrove forests were added in 2020 from 2018, of which 59 percent were artificially planted and 41 percent restored naturally. Around 150 hectares of mangrove forests have depleted, some of which are caused by human activities such as pond reclamation and port construction. According to sources at the center, they will make full use of satellite remote sensing and other technologies to continuously monitor mangrove forest growth and the impact of human activities, to support mangrove conservation and ecological restoration. You can now support this project by donating your ecopoints in exchange funds to support the volunteering program of mangrove conservation and ecological restoration.',
    'The economic boom that enriched China has fed urbanization along with the consumption of commodities and other waste-generating activities. The worst pollution in Tibetan area results from rural farmers\' markets and the common use of plastic bags, which are super-thin and relatively expensive to recycle. The association taps the volunteer spirit on the plateau to control abandoned plastic trash, aka "white pollution". The volunteers are of all ages and come from different walks of life, but many of the most active are members of the Tibetan ethnic group who were born in the region\'s preindustrial era, when plastic was rarely used. Whit pollution was "haunting" China\'s vast rural areas. Even though almost a decade had passed since Tibet adopted the plastics ban, some small businesses were still trying to evade inspections, which exacerbated pollution. To improve recycling rates, they are calling for greater efforts to raise awareness of plastic pollution and about the harm plastics do to farmland and livestock.\n\nYou can now support this project by exchanging ecopoints for volunteer funds to control the abandoned plastic trash. 80 ecopoints for ¥10 in volunteering funds to tackle the issue.',
