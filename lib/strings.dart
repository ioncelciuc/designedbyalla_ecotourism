In mGEECO, this is represented in the form of scale that show the increase in the Earth’s average temperature.\n\nWHY IS 1.5 DEGREES THE DANGER LINE FOR GLOBAL WARMING?\n\n“Coral reefs would decline by 70-90 percent with global warming of 1.5°C, whereas virtually all would be lost with 2°C”\n\nAdapting to a 1.5°C global temperature rise would be less difficult, costly, and lead to less human harm. But letting the warming rise just a half-degree, to 2°C, would add an average of 4 inches of global sea level rise. Going above 1.5 degrees of warming puts millions more at risk of potentially life-threatening heatwaves and poverty. It all but wipes out coral reefs that entire ecosystems rely on worldwide. Seas swallow even more of our cities. And that’s just for starters.',

In 2006, it went under 4 years restoration work due to the damages done by the tourist. The lake is classified as a highest-level scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration and was listed by UNESCO as a world heritage site in 1990.\n\nIn mGEECO, the problem at ecosite represent how tourist have impacted wilderness at ecotourism destination.
